# Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to allow me to experiment with using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. This repo is not really entended for anyone else to use for anything.

## Background

In the past, I used raspberry pi 3B+ models in my classroom.  Those pis were purchased by the prior computer science teacher at me school.  The 3B+ models more fine.  They are a little slow, but it is a tiny computer.   
I recently had the opportunity to upgrade my class set to raspberry pi 5 models.  They are great. They are very fast (for a tiny computer).  
I purchased a zero 2 model to see how it handle the types of activities that we do in my class. 

## Why test a Zero 2 W

I had a few teachers ask me to share my intro to linux lesson with them.  I was happy to share because I also struggled to find ways to teach linux when I started teaching programming.  I like the unit that I developed because it is a fun way to ease into using linux.  The project involves locally hosting a website and the students enjoy it.
My concern about sharing the unit was the cost.  Purchasing 26 raspberry pi 5s comes with a significant cost (significant to me at least). So I wanted to test the lowest cost pi that I thought would handle it. Zero 2 W.

## What I found

The Zero 2 W has the theoretical capabilities to render a desktop and browser. However, it is so under powered that I was not able to get those to run effectively.  So would not recommend trying to recreate my linux unit with a Zero.
But, I did find that it runs well using a Rasbian Lite OS without a desktop environment. It's fast and does everything I needed, including locally hosting a simple html site using python http.server.  
I also found that not having a desktop environment to go when I struggle with using the terminal is very challenging and fun.(nerd)  
I have setup the pi, connected to wifi, connected to git and github, connected a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, configured nano...  I am editing this readme on the zero from the nano editor now.  
And all of this is from a super tiny computer that is currently running on a battery pack that I have to recharge my phone when I am traveling.  

## My Take a Way
Zeros are not a viable replacement for a 5 or 3B+.  But they are very small, energy efficient, very cool and fun to use.
